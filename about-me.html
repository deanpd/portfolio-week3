      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p class="hola">While growing up, we always had a Mac in the house. Getting to play with Kid Pix was my Saturday morning cartoons. Photoshop was installed soon after, and my dad made me into a green, three-eyed alien who lived on the moon. Since that close encounter, visual arts have been my passion. I remember messing around in Macromedia Extreme 3D as a tween and thinking how cool it would be do this for a living. Iâ€™m lucky to have had the support to get my Bachelor of Fine Arts in Graphic Design from <a href="http://www.artcenter.edu/accd/index.jsp">Art Center College of Design</a> in Pasadena, California, and make visual arts my living. After Art Center, I replaced the smog and concrete of Southern California with the forests, mountains, and ocean of Bellingham, Washington.</p>
